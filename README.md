Scaner is not really what it's name says. This is a program, which does many thing. For the first point - it copy's files
from the selected directory to another. Next, it check's for the md5 coincidence (even if files have differrent name's 
and\or different size), and delet's them. Now, it is everything. More options coming soon!
